# Hey, I'm Allan D'Souza

**Design Engineer** based in Mumbai.

I build interfaces that feel right — prototyping in code because that's where ideas come alive.

---

## What I Do

- Design and build web applications with React, TypeScript, and Next.js
- Obsess over micro-interactions and how they change perception
- Ship fast, learn faster

---

## Background

5+ years as a **Game Designer** at Apar Games — designing gameplay mechanics, feedback loops, and experiences that kept users engaged. Shipped 10+ titles across Steam, iOS, Android, and web.

Now applying that same attention to detail to web interfaces.

## AI in My Workflow

I use Claude, Cursor, and AI tools daily — not just for coding, but for exploring ideas faster.
